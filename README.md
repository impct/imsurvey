In May 2014, a team from .impact released a survey to better understand the EA community. Before this, weâ€™ve mostly been using our first-hand, anecdotal impressions to describe the community. A few EA organizations have done surveys of their own supporters, but this  particular survey supplies a more systematic understanding of EAs.  Complete analysis forthcoming.

Hopefully the results in this survey are useful enough to justify the cost of running the survey.  We plan on running this survey on an annual basis.
