## The 2014 EA Survey

In May 2014, a team from .impact released a survey to better understand the EA community. Before this, weâ€™ve mostly been using our first-hand, anecdotal impressions to describe the community. A few EA organizations have done surveys of their own supporters, but this  particular survey supplies a more systematic understanding of EAs.

[The full analysis was published on the EA forum](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/gb/the_2014_survey_of_effective_altruists_results/) on March 2015.
